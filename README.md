# nlp-time
NLP time parser for time, range, and cron pattern. This is based on CFG and algorithm proven in [CFG.md](./CFG.md)

This is under still development.

## Todo

- ok if the dateStrArr parseable by subnormal, override
do it at preinjection

ok take the results of parseNormal, the dateStrArr, on each, parseSubnormal, if full result conforms to reT regex, replace

- maybe allow for operator to change bet t,dt
- observe the extra smaller rules in the new production rules
